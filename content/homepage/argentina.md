### Where to Stay

### Things to do
#### Argentina
1. [Iguaz√∫ Falls](https://maps.app.goo.gl/E98ew6bZwAQHn1Vi7): where Mother Nature goes all-in with her waterworks display. A Unesco World Heritage site.
2. [Patagonia Glaciers](https://maps.app.goo.gl/b73zYKThE3ASwZb57): where the ice is colder than your ex's heart, but the views are even more breathtaking! Head down to El Calafate and hike up to view some of South America's largest glaciers.
3. [Mendoza](https://maps.app.goo.gl/gsZXgQDTysMfiiX2A): "Wine is bottled poetry." Sip your way through endless vineyards, surrounded by the stunning backdrop of the Andes mountains. You'll leave with a "spirited" appreciation for life, and maybe a wine stain or two on your shirt.
4. [Bariloche](https://maps.app.goo.gl/VD6Jhcgk6gWx7sNJ7): the land of chocolate dreams and mountainous ice cream! Beautiful mountains in the picturesque south of Argentina - hiking, biking, watersports, or just cozy walks during the beginning of Autumn. 
5. [Quebrada de Humahuaca](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SrvxzL3YQG6kzxsD6): explore colorful adobe villages, follow ancient Inca trails, and bask in the stunning desert landscape that looks like it was painted by a team of artistic llamas. A Unesco World Heritage site.
